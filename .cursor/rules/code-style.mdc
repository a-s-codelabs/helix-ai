simple, understandable code is better than clever code
write code that are direct and easy to understand
ok with iterative and declarative style

use best practice
when writing fn - create input and output types

comment only when necessary example why this code is needed
don't create unnecessary docs

avoid unnecessary abstraction
avoid creating code and files unnecessarily, try to use created code
do only necessary changes
