simple, understandable code is better than clever code
write code that are direct and easy to understand
ok with iterative and declarative style

use best practice
when writing fn - create input and output types
avoid unnecessary abstraction

comment only when necessary example why this code is needed
don't create unnecessary docs

do only necessary changes
